## Beta testing 

You can try last beta build by accessing the [TestFlight Link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/lCeTuDKM).

## Build instructions

If you have already everything installed, opening the project workspace in Xcode should be as easy as:

```
$ xcodegen                  # Create the xcodeproj with all project source files
$ pod install               # Create the xcworkspace with all project dependencies
$ open Riot.xcworkspace     # Open Xcode
```

Else, you can visit our [installation guide](./INSTALL.md). This guide also offers more details and advanced usage like using [MatrixSDK](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk) in its development version.
